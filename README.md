# Footnote.js

## Note

Footnote.js is actually written in CoffeeScript, so the actual source is footnote.coffee. The compiled javascript is included for convenience.

## Usage

Just make an element with the class "fn-document" and then have elements with the class "footnote" contain footnotes. If you want to denote where your footnotes will appear, denote them by making an element of the class "fn-holder" somewhere in your fn-document element. Otherwise, it'll appear at the bottom of your element.

That's pretty much it. Good luck.
